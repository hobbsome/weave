# Weave
Dead simple Swift networking.
## What is Weave?
Weave is a open-source networking layer build on top of `NSURLSession`. It is lightweight yet still has useful features. When designing Weave, I had three main goals:
1. Provide powerful features that weren't in any other framework.
2. Provide simplicity in implementation and API.
3. Make it easy for users to integrate and use.
## Documentation
Documentation is available at [hobbsome.com/weave](http://www.hobbsome.com/weave).
## Get Started & Installation
There are two main different ways to use Weave:
1. Build & maintain from source
2. Download framework
### Build and Integrate

2. Make sure you're working in a Xcode Workspace. 
3. Then, simply drag the .xcodeproj onto the File Browser in Xcode.
